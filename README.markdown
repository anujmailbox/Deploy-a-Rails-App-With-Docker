# Deploy a Rails Application with Docker
## Instructor: [Jos√© Mota][instructor url]

This course will cover the process of deploying a standard database-backed Rails application with Docker containers. This process is becoming more and more popular, due to its set of features and potential for easier, more valuable deployments. In this course we'll go from creating a base docker container capable of running a simple Rails application, all the way to a deployment-ready solution using ngnix for static content and a Postgres database.

Source files contain the completed Rails application, organised into industry-standard folders, along with a Dockerfile and complementary deployment files.
